  "description": "Lin Jie is an otherworlder who manages a bookstore. He’s kind and always recommends soul-healing books for his dejected customers. Sometimes he’d even share his own works too. As time goes on, these customers start to respect him a lot. They bring simple local products every day to show their gratitude and ask for book recommendations. They even start telling tales of this ordinary shopkeeper. His respectful and cordial titles include “Hyena of the Evil God”, “Herald of the Flesh Gospel”, “Author of Cultes des Goules” and “Shepherd of the Stars”??",
